## Privacy Sandbox Analysis Tool CLI

>The Privacy Sandbox Analysis Tool CLI is designed to help developers audit and analyze their websites in Chrome environments where the unrestricted use of 3P cookies has been blocked.


## Using the CLI

PSAT CLI allows you to audit a single website or multiple websites using a sitemap or a CSV file. It generates a report to help users draft future action items to prepare their websites for environments where the unrestricted use of 3P cookies has been blocked.

> Required Node Version: 18 or later


### Installation

```
npm i -g @google-psat/cli
